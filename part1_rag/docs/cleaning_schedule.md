# Equipment Cleaning Schedule

Maintaining clean equipment is essential for food safety and quality in our space-based coffee operations. Our comprehensive cleaning schedule ensures all equipment meets the highest hygiene standards.

## Deep Cleaning Schedule

**Grinder deep‑clean on Station Day 5.** This weekly deep cleaning process involves complete disassembly, thorough sanitization, and reassembly of all grinder components to ensure optimal performance and hygiene.

## Daily Cleaning Procedures

All equipment undergoes daily cleaning at the end of each shift. This includes espresso machines, milk steamers, and all food preparation surfaces. Special attention is given to areas that come into contact with food products.

## Sanitization Process

Our sanitization process uses space-grade cleaning solutions that are effective in zero-gravity conditions. All cleaning agents are food-safe and approved for use in space station environments.

## Quality Control

Each cleaning cycle is documented and verified by shift supervisors. Random quality checks ensure that cleaning standards are consistently maintained across all shifts and locations.

## Equipment Maintenance

Regular cleaning is combined with preventive maintenance to extend equipment life and ensure consistent performance. Our technical team performs detailed inspections during each deep cleaning cycle.
