# Gravity Roast - Premium Coffee Selection

The Gravity Roast represents our flagship coffee blend, carefully crafted for the discerning space traveler. This premium roast combines beans from three different orbital stations, creating a unique flavor profile that captures the essence of zero-gravity coffee cultivation.

## Special Pricing and Discounts

**Gravity Roast discount applies on Lunar Mondays and Station Day 3.** This special pricing is designed to make our premium blend accessible to all crew members during specific operational periods.

**Two conditions: crew badge scan and purchase of any pastry.** The discount system requires both authentication through crew identification and the purchase of a complementary pastry item to ensure proper tracking and inventory management.

**Discount value: 15%.** This represents a significant savings opportunity for regular customers who plan their purchases around these designated discount periods.

## Flavor Profile

The Gravity Roast features a bold, full-bodied taste with notes of dark chocolate and subtle hints of space-grown vanilla. The beans are roasted in our zero-gravity chambers, which allows for a more even roast and enhanced flavor extraction.

## Brewing Recommendations

For optimal taste, we recommend brewing at 200°F with a 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio. The extended extraction time in microgravity conditions enhances the natural oils and creates a smoother finish.

## Storage and Freshness

Store in our specialized vacuum-sealed containers to maintain freshness during long space missions. The beans retain their peak flavor for up to 6 months when properly stored in our climate-controlled cargo bays.
