# Safety Protocols - Airlock Operations

Safety is our top priority in all operations, and this includes strict protocols regarding airlock operations to ensure the safety of all personnel and customers.

## Critical Safety Rule

**Café staff must never operate airlocks.** This is a fundamental safety requirement that prevents unauthorized access to critical life support systems and maintains proper security protocols.

## Airlock Access Control

Only certified engineering personnel with proper security clearance are authorized to operate airlock systems. This restriction ensures that life support systems remain secure and operational.

## Emergency Procedures

In emergency situations, café staff should immediately contact the engineering team or security personnel. Never attempt to operate airlock controls, even in emergency situations.

## Training Requirements

All café staff receive comprehensive safety training that emphasizes the importance of this restriction. Regular safety briefings reinforce these critical protocols.

## Compliance Monitoring

Security systems monitor all airlock operations to ensure compliance with these safety protocols. Any unauthorized attempts to access airlock controls are immediately reported to security personnel.
