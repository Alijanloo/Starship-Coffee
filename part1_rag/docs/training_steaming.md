# Milk Steaming Training Protocol

Proper milk steaming technique is essential for creating the perfect texture and temperature for our specialty drinks. Our training program ensures all baristas master this critical skill.

## Temperature Standards

**Milk steaming target is 60–65°C.** This temperature range ensures optimal texture and sweetness while maintaining food safety standards in our space-based operations.

## Steaming Technique

The steaming process involves creating microfoam by introducing air into the milk at the correct angle and depth. This technique requires practice and precision to achieve the desired consistency.

## Quality Assessment

Each trainee must demonstrate the ability to consistently produce properly steamed milk within the target temperature range. Quality is assessed through both temperature measurement and visual inspection of foam texture.

## Equipment Training

Trainees learn to use our specialized space-grade steamers, which are designed to work efficiently in zero-gravity conditions. The equipment requires different techniques compared to Earth-based steamers.

## Certification Process

Baristas must pass both written and practical exams before being certified to steam milk for customer orders. Regular recertification ensures skills remain current and consistent.
