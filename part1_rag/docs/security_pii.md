# Security - Personal Information Protection

Protecting customer personal information is a critical responsibility in our space-based operations. We maintain strict protocols to ensure customer privacy and data security.

## Email Privacy Policy

**Never display full emails in receipts.** This policy protects customer privacy by ensuring that sensitive email information is not exposed in printed or digital receipts.

## Data Masking

All customer emails are automatically masked in our systems, showing only partial information (e.g., l***@domain.com) to authorized personnel who need to verify customer identity.

## Receipt Security

Our receipt generation system automatically applies email masking before printing or displaying customer information. This ensures consistent protection across all receipt formats.

## Access Controls

Only authorized personnel with proper clearance can access full customer information. All access is logged and monitored to ensure compliance with privacy protocols.

## Data Retention

Customer information is retained only as long as necessary for business operations and legal compliance. Regular data purging ensures that outdated information is securely removed from our systems.
