# Refund Policy - Starship Coffee Co.

Our refund policy is designed to ensure customer satisfaction while maintaining operational efficiency in our space-based coffee operations. We understand that space travel can be unpredictable, and we strive to accommodate our customers' needs within reasonable parameters.

## Pre-Order Refund Window

**Refund window for pre‑orders is 7 days from docking.** This policy allows customers to modify or cancel their orders within a reasonable timeframe after their spacecraft has docked at our station.

**No refunds after docking + 7 days.** Once the seven-day window has passed, all sales are considered final. This policy helps us maintain accurate inventory and production planning for our limited space-based resources.

## Refund Processing

All refunds are processed through our digital credit system, which automatically updates customer accounts within 24 hours of approval. Refunds can be used for future purchases or converted to station credits for use at other facilities.

## Special Circumstances

In cases of medical emergencies or unexpected mission changes, we may consider exceptions to our standard refund policy. These cases are reviewed individually by our customer service team and station management.

## Quality Guarantee

If you're not satisfied with your order due to quality issues, we offer immediate replacement or full refund within 24 hours of purchase. Our quality control systems ensure that every drink meets our high standards, but we stand behind our products with this guarantee.
