# Nebula Latte - Cosmic Creation

The Nebula Latte is our most popular specialty drink, inspired by the beautiful cosmic phenomena observed from our observation deck. This unique beverage combines traditional coffee artistry with space-age ingredients to create an otherworldly experience.

## Ingredients and Composition

**Nebula Latte contains almond syrup, starfruit extract, and dairy foam.** The combination of these carefully selected ingredients creates a layered flavor profile that evolves as you drink, much like the formation of a nebula in deep space.

**Allergens disclosed: nuts (almond), dairy, starfruit.** We take food safety seriously in our zero-gravity environment, and all potential allergens are clearly marked to ensure crew safety and dietary compliance.

## Preparation Process

The Nebula Latte requires a specialized preparation technique that involves layering the ingredients in a specific order. First, we steam the milk to create the perfect microfoam consistency, then carefully add the starfruit extract to create the signature nebula-like swirl pattern.

## Temperature and Serving

Served at 150°F to maintain the delicate balance of flavors. The drink is presented in our signature transparent mugs that allow customers to appreciate the beautiful layered effect, reminiscent of distant nebulae.

## Customization Options

Available in three sizes: Standard (8oz), Galactic (12oz), and Cosmic (16oz). The starfruit extract can be adjusted for intensity, and we offer dairy-free alternatives using our proprietary space-grown plant milk.
