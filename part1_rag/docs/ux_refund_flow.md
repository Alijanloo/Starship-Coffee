# User Experience - Refund Process

Our refund process is designed to be user-friendly while maintaining proper security and authorization protocols to protect both customers and the business.

## Authorization Requirements

**Refund confirmation requires manager PIN.** This security measure ensures that all refunds are properly authorized and documented, preventing unauthorized transactions.

## Refund Process Flow

The refund process begins when a customer requests a refund through our digital interface or in-person at the café. Staff members initiate the process and enter the required information into our system.

## Manager Authorization

When a refund is requested, the system prompts for manager authorization through PIN entry. This step ensures that all refunds are reviewed and approved by authorized personnel.

## Digital Documentation

All refund transactions are automatically documented in our system, including the reason for the refund, the amount, and the authorizing manager. This creates a complete audit trail for financial accountability.

## Customer Communication

Once authorized, customers receive immediate confirmation of their refund through our digital notification system. The refund is processed through our credit system within 24 hours.
