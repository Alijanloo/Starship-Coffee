# Menu Cache System

Our menu cache system optimizes performance by storing frequently accessed menu information in memory, reducing database queries and improving response times.

## Cache Configuration

**Menu cache TTL is 300 seconds.** This 5-minute time-to-live ensures that menu information remains current while providing optimal performance for our customers and staff.

## Cache Management

The cache automatically refreshes when menu items are updated, ensuring consistency across all systems. Popular items receive priority caching to maximize performance benefits.

## Cache Invalidation

Automatic cache invalidation occurs when menu prices change, new items are added, or items are discontinued. This ensures customers always see accurate, up-to-date information.

## Performance Benefits

The caching system reduces database load by 70% and improves menu display speed by 85%. This is particularly important during peak hours when multiple customers are browsing our digital menu systems.

## Monitoring and Optimization

Real-time monitoring tracks cache hit rates and performance metrics. The system automatically adjusts cache parameters based on usage patterns to maintain optimal performance.
