# Shipping Operations - Module B

Our shipping operations to Module B are a critical component of our supply chain management system. This module serves as a primary distribution hub for our coffee products and related supplies.

## Regular Shipping Schedule

**Beans ship to Module B every other Tuesday.** This bi-weekly schedule ensures consistent supply while allowing for proper inventory rotation and quality control measures.

**Fallback: reroute to Module C via maintenance corridor.** In cases where Module B is unavailable or experiencing technical difficulties, our automated systems will redirect shipments through the maintenance corridor to reach Module C as an alternative distribution point.

## Shipping Procedures

All shipments are packaged in specialized containers designed to maintain coffee bean freshness during transit. Our vacuum-sealed packaging system ensures that beans retain their optimal flavor profile throughout the shipping process.

## Quality Control

Each shipment undergoes rigorous quality testing before departure, including moisture content analysis, bean density measurements, and flavor profile verification. Only beans that meet our strict quality standards are approved for shipping.

## Tracking and Monitoring

Real-time tracking systems monitor each shipment's progress through the station's transportation network. Customers can track their orders through our digital interface, receiving updates at each checkpoint along the route.
